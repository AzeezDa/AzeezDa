## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Azeez and I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm, Sweden. I have authored the equation-solving and optimisation library [eqsolver](https://github.com/AzeezDa/eqsolver) for The Rust Programming Language ðŸ¦€. In my free time, I usually work on libraries or do fun small projects. You can see my projects pinned on my [GitHub](https://github.com/AzeezDa) or in my [portfolio](https://azeezda.github.io/portfolio/)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Journaling Application built using Tauri, Svelte and Typescript.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cross-platform desktop application development with Tauri.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mathematics-oriented libraries or projects, especially written in Rust or C/C++.
