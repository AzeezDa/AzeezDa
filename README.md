## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Azeez and I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I usually write and maintain libraries in The Rust Programming Language ðŸ¦€ or work on small fun projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Journaling Application using tauri, Svelte and Typescript.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cross-platform desktop application development with tauri.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mathematics-oriented libraries or projects, especially written in Rust or C/C++.
